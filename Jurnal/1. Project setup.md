## Project specifications
[Wikipedia details about url shortening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening).

### Existing implementations
- [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com)
- [tly](https://t.ly/register?via=shorturl)

### Short ideas to implement
- Add ephemeral links. That are no longer available after a set timer.

## Project structure

Split the projects in the following components
- DotUrlShortenerUi - blazor ssr app
- DotUrlShortenerApi - minimal api

Additionally, we have the Aspire and testing projects.

## Issues encountered during project setup

### Certificate issue
Solved by restarting the browser. [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/untrusted-localhost-certificate) are some details on it.

### Scalar interaction wth Aspire
Due to how aspire deploys the projects we've encountered some issues with the Scalar tool [issue link](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/573320).
